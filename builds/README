= The builds/ folder =

This folder contains builds generated by the auto-deploy framework for
profiles. The hierarchy of this folder is the following:

builds/:
    - $project/         # each project previously compiled (mesa, linux, ...)
        - builds/       # all the versions compiled previously
            - $version  # version compiled (often a git reversion)
                - ...   # whatever is needed to deploy the version
        - tmp/          # folder used when compiling a new version
        - cur/          # symbolic link to the current version deployed
