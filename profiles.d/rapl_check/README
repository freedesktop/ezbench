# RAPL checker

## Introduction

The point of this profile is to check how accurate the power value reported by
RAPL actually is, when compared to an actual power meter.

Right now, only the Yokogawa WT310 power meter is supported as a comparaison.

## Dependencies

### Hardware
- Having a yokogawa WT310 power meter connected in USB and properly configured.
  See user_paramaters.sh for more information.

### Software

- Ezbench's core.sh properly configured to run benchmarks
- Python3
- Scipy/Numpy
- Matplotlib with a GUI backend

## How to?

The following example shows you what you need to do to run test RAPL:

    ./core.sh -P rapl_check -N MY_UNIQUE_NAME -r 1 -b $as_many_bencharks_as_possible
    profiles.d/rapl_check/rapl_check.py -c logs/MY_UNIQUE_NAME/rapl_report

This will take some time and then open a window containing the results.

### Interpretating the results

In the window created by rapl_check.py, you can see multiple plots:

 - The raw power consumption reported by RAPL (package domain), and the system
   power, as reported by the external power meter

 - The normalized power consumptions. Same view as the raw view, except that
   we substracted the average of each plot to every sample point. This should
   make the two plots closely track each others

 - The time correlation view allows checking if RAPL and the power meter are
   in sync. Make sure that the highest value is aligned with the expected peak.

   WARNING: If it is not aligned, you will need to add support for compensating
   for this :s

 - The difference histogram view allows visualising as an histogram the
   difference between RAPL and the power meter. This allows to get an estimate
   about how accurate the readings are and what is the margin of error for RAPL
   at whatever percentile you want.

 - The scaling factor view allows checking if the power output reported by the
   power meter would be affine with the power reported by RAPL. As strong slope
   in the regression line may indicate that the computer's power supply's
   efficiency varies greatly depending on the power consumption.

 - Finally, the last view takes the result of the previous view to show a
   compensated version of the normalized power consumption. This view should
   show the reported values by both RAPL and the power meter to be very close to
   each others. Check out the difference in Joules and verify that it is close
   to 0.

That's all, folks!
